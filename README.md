### Woniverse

‘Woniverse’ is Cloudforet’s worldview set in Universe(from multi-clouds to entire IT infrastructure).

In a cloud world as wide and deep as the universe, it is easy to get lost.
Event if just one thing goes wrong, will be going into the black hole.

Wonny, which has existed after the universe was born, knows all about the world.
Besides, there are Jelly Octoz by Wonny’s side.
If you are exploring the universe with Wonny and Jelly Octos, you can safely and easily explore the world as you want.

#### [Wonny](woniverse/wonny)

* Wonny is omnipotent in the cloud world.
* Wonny made himself look like an astronaut to commnicate friendly with the people on Earth.
* Wonny likes to collect planets and decorate galaxies.
* Wonny hates surveillance cameras. 
He has heard someone say that Wonny and the surveillance cameras looked alike, and perhaps he disagrees.

#### [Jelly Octos](woniverse/jellyotos)

* Jelly Octos love Wonny, and they often help Wonny with his work.
* Jelly Octos can’t do many things at once. They prefer to do one thing at a time.
* Each Jelly Octos has its own unique talent.
